# Week 12: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

<LearningObjective objectives={[
  "Integrate OpenAI Whisper for voice commands",
  "Connect VLM to robot actions",
  "Execute cognitive planning"
]} />

## 1. VLA Architecture

**VLA (Vision-Language-Action)** models like Google's RT-2 or similar architectures combine:
1.  **Vision**: Understanding the scene ("I see an apple").
2.  **Language**: Understanding the command ("Pick up the healthy snack").
3.  **Action**: outputting robot arm waypoints.

## 2. Cognitive Planning

Using LLMs (like GPT-4) as the "High Level Planner".
*   **User**: "I spilled my drink."
*   **LLM**: "1. Find sponge. 2. Pick up sponge. 3. Go to spill. 4. Wipe."

## 3. Lab: Voice-Controlled Pick & Place

Integrate **OpenAI Whisper** (Speech-to-Text) with a simple VLM API to command the simulation.
