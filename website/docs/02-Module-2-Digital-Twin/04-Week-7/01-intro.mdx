# Week 7: Unity & Bridges

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

<LearningObjective objectives={[
  "Set up Unity Robotics Hub",
  "Bridge ROS 2 with Unity via TCP",
  "Create photorealistic environments"
]} />

## 1. Why Unity?

Gazebo is great for physics, but Unity offers **Game-Engine quality graphics**. This is crucial for Computer Vision tasks where lighting and texture matter.

## 2. ROS-TCP-Connector

Unity communicates with ROS 2 using a TCP endpoint.
*   **Unity**: Sender/Receiver scripts (C#).
*   **ROS 2**: `ros_tcp_endpoint` node.

## 3. Lab: Visualizing Pick & Place

1.  Import a robotic arm (UR3e) into Unity.
2.  Setup the ROS subscriber for joint angles.
3.  Publish joint angles from a ROS 2 terminal and watch the Unity arm move.
