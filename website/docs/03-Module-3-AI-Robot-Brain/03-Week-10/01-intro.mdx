# Week 10: Navigation 2 (Nav2)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

<LearningObjective objectives={[
  "Configure the Nav2 stack costmaps",
  "Tune planners and controllers",
  "Send autonomous waypoints"
]} />

## 1. The Nav2 Stack Architecture

Nav2 is the industry standard for mobile robotics navigation.
*   **Planner (Global)**: Dijkstra/A* algorithm to find path from A to B.
*   **Controller (Local)**: Follows the path while avoiding dynamic obstacles (people, pets).
*   **Costmaps**: 2D grid representing safe/unsafe areas.

## 2. Costmap Layers

1.  **Static Layer**: Walls (from SLAM map).
2.  **Obstacle Layer**: Real-time Lidar data.
3.  **Inflation Layer**: Padding around obstacles to prevent collision.

## 3. Lab: Autonomous Waypoints

Use the "2D Nav Goal" tool in RViz to command the robot to go to the kitchen.
