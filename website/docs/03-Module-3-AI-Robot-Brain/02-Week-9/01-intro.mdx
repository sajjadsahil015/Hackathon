# Week 9: Visual SLAM

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

<LearningObjective objectives={[
  "Understand Simultaneous Localization and Mapping",
  "Deploy RTAB-Map with RGB-D cameras",
  "Generate 2D and 3D occupancy grids"
]} />

## 1. What is SLAM?

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** is the chicken-and-egg problem:
1.  To map the room, I need to know where I am.
2.  To know where I am, I need a map of the room.

## 2. Visual SLAM (vSLAM)

Using cameras (RGB-D or Stereo) to extract feature points from the environment.
*   **Loop Closure**: Recognizing a place we've been before to correct drift.
*   **RTAB-Map**: Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping.

## 3. Lab: Mapping the Virtual Home

Drive the robot around the Unity/Isaac house environment. Watch the 3D pointcloud map build up in RViz.
