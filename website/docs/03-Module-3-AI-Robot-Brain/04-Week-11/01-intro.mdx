# Week 11: Behavior Trees

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

<LearningObjective objectives={[
  "Design complex behaviors using Behavior Trees",
  "Integrate Nav2 with custom actions",
  "Create a patrol application"
]} />

## 1. State Machines vs Behavior Trees

*   **Finite State Machines (FSM)**: Rigid states (Idle -> Moving -> Error). Hard to scale.
*   **Behavior Trees (BT)**: Modular, hierarchical logic (Sequence, Fallback, Parallel). Used in Halo AI and Nav2.

### BT Nodes
*   **Action**: Do something (Move, Speak).
*   **Condition**: Check something (IsBatteryLow?).
*   **Control**: Logic flow (Sequence: Do A, then B).

## 2. Lab: Security Patrol

Create a Behavior Tree that:
1.  Patrols Points A, B, C.
2.  **Fallback**: If battery < 20%, go to Dock.
