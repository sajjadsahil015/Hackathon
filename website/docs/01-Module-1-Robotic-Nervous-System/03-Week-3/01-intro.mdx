# Week 3: Advanced ROS 2

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

<LearningObjective objectives={[
  "Execute long-running tasks with Actions",
  "Configure nodes dynamically with Parameters",
  "Manage multi-node systems with Launch files"
]} />

## 1. Actions: Goals with Feedback

Unlike Services, **Actions** are preemptable and provide feedback.
*   **Example**: "Go to the kitchen."
    *   *Feedback*: "Moving... 10%... 50%..."
    *   *Cancel*: "Stop! I changed my mind."

## 2. Parameters

Parameters allow you to configure nodes at runtime without recompiling.
*   `max_speed`: 2.0 m/s
*   `camera_resolution`: 1080p

## 3. Launch Files (Python)

Starting 10 nodes manually is tedious. Launch files script this.

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            executable='turtlesim_node',
            name='sim'
        ),
    ])
```
