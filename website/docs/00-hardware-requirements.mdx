# Hardware Requirements

To successfully complete this course, you will need access to two types of compute environments.

## The Dual-Stack Approach

Physical AI requires training in high-fidelity simulation (The Digital Twin) and deployment on constrained hardware (The Robot Brain).

<HardwareComparison profiles={profiles} />

### 1. The Digital Twin Workstation
This machine is used for:
- Running **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** (Requires RTX GPU)
- Photorealistic rendering in **Unity**
- Training Vision-Language-Action models
- Compiling large ROS 2 workspaces

### 2. The Edge AI Kit (Robot Brain)
This computer lives inside the robot:
- Runs **ROS 2 Humble**
- Handles real-time sensor fusion
- Executes the trained policy
- **Recommended**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin series (AGX or Nano)
